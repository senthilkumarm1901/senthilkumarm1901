<details> <summary> :ballot_box_with_check: How did my career start? </summary>

<br>
  
- Back in July 2010, I had started out providing customized Market Research (MR) in my first 4 years of my career. 
    - Simply put, it was a "no-code work" involving cold-calling, speaking to experts and readig a lot of material to write actionable procurement intelligence reports . <br>
    - This first job, right after my engineering undergraduation, had taught me the importance of tough-to-learn skills of communication - written, one-on-one, cold-calling, team presentations and many more. 
    - I am glad I started out there for it sowed the seeds in me to crave the learning for softer-but-tougher skills in corporate world <br>

<details> <summary> :ballot_box_with_check: When did I transition to NLP? </summary> <br>

<br>
  
- Since 2014, I have been in the field of Data Science, and the romance has not died down yet :). Largely because of the ever-interesting NLP opportunities that landed my way. <br>
- I had primarily worked on `Social Media Analytics` at `LatentView` from 2014 to 2018 where <br> 
    - I had aided my F100 tech major client to effectively use social media insights in their marketing decisions
- Ever since my stint as Data Scientist at Ford since May 2018, my technical learnings have taken a even better trajectory! 
</details>

    
<details> <summary> :ballot_box_with_check: What are my mottos? </summary>

<br>
  
  - To keep **upskilling my technical knowledge** 
      - Firmly believe there are **Miles to go before I sleep** <br> 
  - To **stand on the shoulders of the giants of open source** 
      - In other words, be **applied practitioner** first, and not try to reinvent the wheel unless it has some learning/business benefit 
  - To bring **the best collaborative, transparent, humble self in my interactions** with colleagues, 
      - This is so that trust is enabled, long-term partnerships are forged and great results are achieved <br>

### `$ WhoAmI --personal_identity`   

<details> <summary> :ballot_box_with_check: My Small World </summary>
 
 <br>
  
  - I am here working happily in the Data Science field largely because of my `wife` . She guided my transition. She is a fellow analytics professional too <br>
      - She is on a break to take care of our possibly autistic todler son. <br>
      - I am cognizant of this privilege that I am enjoying (me being able to work when she couldn't). <br>
      - It has been particularly exacerbated by covid situation <br>
      - And we are working hard to ensure she gets back to active work soon <br>
 - Speaking of my `son` <br> 
      - He is the apple of my eye <br>
      - He is learning slow on social interactions for a regular kid 
          - but seem to have exemplary memory (well beyond his age!) <br>
          - and grasps abstract things like shapes, numbers, letters, and words faster

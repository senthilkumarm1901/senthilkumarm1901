<details> <summary> Who am I (professionally speaking)? </summary>
  
Phew, 11+ years  does sound a lot. But wait, before you tag me "manager" material, I must confess I like being **hands-on** and have chosen roles to enhance my technical skills. 
<br>
** How did my journey start?** <br>
- Back in July 2010, I had started out providing customized Market Research (MR) in my first 4 years of my career. Simply put for coders a "no-code work". <br>
- This first job, right after my engineering undergraduation, had taught me the importance of tough-to-learn skills of communication - written, one-on-one, cold-calling, team presentations and many more. I am glad I started out there for it sowed the seeds in me to crave the learning for softer-but-tougher skills in corporate world <br>

 
** An NLP Fanboy since 2014 ** <br>

Since 2014, I have been in the field of Data Science, and the romance has not died down yet :). Largely because of the ever-interesting NLP opportunities that landed my way.

<details> <summary> Who am I (professionally speaking)? </summary>
  
Phew, 11+ years  does sound a lot. But wait, before you tag me "manager" material, I must confess I like being **hands-on** and have chosen roles to enhance my technical skills. 

<br>
  
**How did my journey start?** <br>
- Back in July 2010, I had started out providing customized Market Research (MR) in my first 4 years of my career. Simply put for coders a "no-code work". <br>
- This first job, right after my engineering undergraduation, had taught me the importance of tough-to-learn skills of communication - written, one-on-one, cold-calling, team presentations and many more. I am glad I started out there for it sowed the seeds in me to crave the learning for softer-but-tougher skills in corporate world <br>

 
**An NLP Fanboy since 2014** <br>

Since 2014, I have been in the field of Data Science, and the romance has not died down yet :). Largely because of the ever-interesting NLP opportunities that landed my way.

<br>
  
  
  
**What is my motto?** <br>
 
  - To keep **upskilling my technical knowledge**. Miles to go before I sleep <br> 
  - To stand on the shoulders of the giants of open source and leverage on their work. In other words, be **applied practitioner** first, and not try to reinvent the wheel unless it has some learning/business benefit <br>
  - To bring the best collaborative, transparent, humble self in my interactions with colleagues - so that trust is enabled, long-term partnerships are forged and great results are achieved <br>
  - To imbibe & exhibit good consulting and business communication practices in all my interactions

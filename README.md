## :office_worker: Short Summaries of my Key Projects ... 

<details><summary>Project #1: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis</summary>

<br>
	
- Built a reusable Sequence Classification ML Pipeline which converts customer comments into `Aspects` and `Sentiment`
- USPs of the Pipeline: 
    - Spark Preprocessing, TL+Clustering aided Annotation and Dockerized Transformer Fine-tuned Model Training and Inference 
    - Less annotation for Training (compared to traditional ML) by intelligent use of DL models
 - Look [here](https://github.com/senthilkumarm1901/senthilkumarm1901/blob/main/KeyProjects.md#project-1-aspect-based-sentiment-analysis) for more details

</details>
	
<details><summary>Project #2: Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Detection using NER</summary>

<br>
	
- Annonymized PII in text data that resulted in less restricted use of the data 
    - by building a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system that can detect PII 
- USPs of the Pipeline: 
    - Bootstrapped the training data using Spacy rules (thus easing the annotation process)
    - Spacy's Roberta Base Transformer model allowed for no truncation of sentence max length
    - Inference REST API (via an asynchronous FastAPI deployment using K8s) that can be plugged into multiple applications
 - Look [here](https://github.com/senthilkumarm1901/senthilkumarm1901/blob/main/KeyProjects.md#project-2-personally-identifiable-information-pii-detection-using-ner) for more details
</details>

<details><summary>Project #3: Unsupervised Clustering Pipeline</summary>

<br>
	
	
- Built reusable Text Clustering pipelines 
    - for deriving actionable insights from unlabeled text corpus
- USPs of the Pipeline: 
    - The clustering pipeline provided options for both Traditional Topic Modeling and DL-Embedding based Hard Clustering
    - Incorporated the models into an easy-to-use `Streamlit` UI deployed via K8s 
    - The codebase was built on top of the main open source libraries
        - PyTorch (Transformers, Sentence Transformers) and Sklearn
 - Look [here](https://github.com/senthilkumarm1901/senthilkumarm1901/blob/main/KeyProjects.md#project-3-unsupervised-text-data-clustering-pipeline) for more details

<details> <summary>How did I start my career?  </summary>

<br>
  
- Back in July 2010, I had started out providing customized Market Research (MR) in my first 4 years of my career. 
  - Simply put, it was a `no-code work` 
       - involving cold-calling, speaking to experts and reading a lot of secondary research material 
       - to write actionable procurement intelligence reports . 
  - This first job, right after my engineering undergraduation, 
       - had taught me the importance of tough-to-learn soft skills 
       - especially in communication be it written, one-on-one, cold-calling, team presentations and many more. 

</details>

<details> <summary>When did I transition to NLP?  </summary>

<br>
  
- Since 2014, I have been in the field of Data Science, and the romance has not died down yet :). 
- Largely because of the interesting NLP opportunities that landed my way. <br>
- I had primarily worked on `Social Media Analytics` at `LatentView` from 2014 to 2018 where <br> 
    - I had aided my F100 tech major client to effectively use social media insights in their marketing decisions
- Since May 2018, as a Data Scientist at Ford,
    - my technical learnings in ML/DL and NLP have been on an upward trend! 

</details>

    
<details> <summary> What are my mottos?  </summary>

<br>
  
  Striving to follow the below mottos for professional betterment: <br> 
  - To keep **upskilling my technical knowledge** 
      - Firmly believe there are **Miles to go before I sleep** <br> 
  - To bring **the best collaborative, transparent and importantly humble self in my interactions** with colleagues/friends, 
      - This is so that trust is enabled, long-term partnerships are forged and great results are achieved <br>
   - To **stand on the shoulders of the giants of open source** 
      - In other words, be **applied practitioner** first, and not try to reinvent the wheel unless it has some learning/business benefit

<details> <summary> My Small World  </summary>
 
 <br>
  
  - I am here working happily in the Data Science field largely because of the sacrifice & guidance of my `wife` . 
      - She guided my transition from Market Research to Data Science. She is a fellow analytics professional too <br>
      - She is on a break to take care of our possibly autistic todler son. <br>
      - I am cognizant of this privilege that I am enjoying (me being able to work when she couldn't). <br>
      - It has been particularly exacerbated by covid situation and personal losses <br>

 - Speaking of my `son` <br> 
      - He is the apple of my eye <br>
      - He seems to have exemplary memory, well beyond his age! (possibly biased opinion üôÇ)   
      - He grasps abstract things like shapes, numbers, letters, and words faster
      - He could be in some autism spectrum (slower learning in social skills compared to kids of his age) <br>
            - With my wife's leadership we diagnosed it early and <br>
            - Hopefully we are acting on it early before it becoming too noticeable 
  
</details>


<details> <summary> My Interests  </summary>

  <br>
  
  - For last 2 years, I have spent (okay, wasted!) a lot of time on many must-watch TV series. Some iconic I must say. <br>
      - My favorite genres: Sci-Fi, Comics, Legal/Medical thrillers and anything out of this world <br>
  - My favorites among novels include many mythology fictional writings <br>
  - An ardent tea lover!
